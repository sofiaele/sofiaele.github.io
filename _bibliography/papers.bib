abstract = {The task of recognizing emotions in speech signals has various real-world applications in domains such as human-computer interaction and multimedia information retrieval. In this work, we examine the ability of Convolutional Neural Networks to transfer cross-linguistic and cross-domain knowledge from datasets with sufficient resources in the English language to datasets with under-represented resources. In particular, we focus on recognizing emotions in speech signals from theatrical plays in the Greek language. Recognizing emotions in theatrical plays can help in building systems that focus on providing automated transcriptions to people with hearing loss, not only with regards to what is being said in a theatrical play, but also how is it said (in terms of emotional energy and sentiment). This can help in reducing the exclusion of this group of population from such cultural activities and therefore significantly improve their quality of life. Experimental results on a publicly available Greek Theatrical dataset (1) prove that transferring knowledge from an English Speech Emotion Recognition dataset using CNNs leads to improved results, compared to training from scratch on the former one.},
