I am a Machine learning engineer at Behavioral Signals. I hold a master's equivalent degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).
Over the past years, I have made significant contributions as a Research Associate at the Computational Intelligence Laboratory of the Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications at NCSR "Demokritos". 

My primary research interests lie in multimodal machine learning and deep learning, with a particular passion for speech-related applications. 
I am currently pursuing my PhD studies, jointly affiliated with NCSR Demokritos and the Department of Informatics at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB). My doctoral research centers on "Behavioral Analysis in Human Communication using Deep Learning".

In my free time, I am an avid traveler, exploring new cultures and destinations around the world. I am also an enthusiastic reader, with a deep love for books, and enjoy delving into various literary genres. Additionally, I haVE a keen interest in the art of acting, which I actively pursue as a hobby.
