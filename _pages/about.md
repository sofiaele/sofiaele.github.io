I am a Machine learning engineer at Behavioral Signals. I hold a master's equivalent degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).

Over the past years, I have made significant contributions as a Research Associate at the Computational Intelligence Laboratory of the Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications at NCSR "Demokritos". My primary research interests lie in multimodal machine learning and deep learning, with a particular passion for speech-related applications. 

I am currently pursuing my PhD studies, jointly affiliated with NCSR Demokritos and the Department of Informatics at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB) under the supervision of [Theodoros Giannakopoulos](https://tyiannak.github.io/), [Ion Androutsopoulos](https://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/) and [Themos Stafylakis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kdEnoP0AAAAJ&hl=el). My doctoral research centers on "Behavioral Analysis in Human Communication using Deep Learning".
